= SOON
  * fix duplication of routes/methods to accommodate file extensions
  * working launchd plist
  * deleting pages 
  * pushing repo

= LATER/MAYBE
  * repo stats/info/maintenance page
  * backlinks (trivial syntax, ideally)
  * outliner functionality
  * menubar item launcher (like Instiki back in the day)
  * RubyCocoa GUI
  
= DONE
  * "append selected text/link to page" bookmarklet (shamelessly cribbed 
    from Trsly/Instapaper) 
  * allow "code pages" by supporting file extensions, applying syntax 
    highlighting
  * next/previous commit links on pages
  * pretty stylesheet
  
= PROBABLY NOT
  * Shoes GUI: Shoes is still pretty immature, ex: all paths are relative 
    to the `shoes` binary making requires a pain, etc.
